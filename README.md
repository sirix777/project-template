## Project Template

Example service that should be used as a starting point for new projects.

This template uses PHP (â‰¥ 8.4) and integrates several libraries and frameworks out of the box, including:
- Mezzio (PSR-15 middleware framework)
- Laminas (components for service management, configuration, etc.)
- Cycle ORM (for database interactions)
- Monolog (for logging)
- PHPUnit (for testing)
- Code quality tools (PHPStan, Rector, PHP-CS-Fixer, Deptrac)

The project is built on a modular architecture and consists of the following modules:
 - ApiGateway (handles API requests and routing)
 - Common (contains shared functionality)
 - ExampleModule (demonstrates module implementation)

The modules apply the principle of clean architecture, they are divided into layers: 
 - App (Application layer - contains use cases and application services)
 - Domain (Domain layer - contains business logic, entities, and domain services)
 - Infra (Infrastructure layer - contains implementations of repositories, external services, etc.)
